# ChatGPT clone with Streaming Feature using Streamlit


Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Streaming tutorial form LangChain and Streamlit. This repository contains the code for the Streamlit app that we will be building in the tutorial. The app is a chatbot that will remember the previous messages and respond to the user's input. The response from the chatbot will be streamed as it is being generated.

## Usage

To run the app, you will need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required packages by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Specify the OpenAI_API_Key:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="Your OpenAI API Key"
```

Once you have installed the required packages, you can run the app by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start the Streamlit app, and you will be able to interact with the chatbot in your web browser.
